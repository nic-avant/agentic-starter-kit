# Agentic Start Kit

This repository contains the Agentic Start Kit, a template for new projects
that includes the basic structure and documentation required for a successful
project.

## How To

See [User Instructions](./USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for how to get started

Once you are satisfied with the structure and content of `agent/` you can
remove this README and ask the model to generate a new one for your project.

Happy prompting!
