## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - Read Carefully

- When attempting to solve a problem, **ALWAYS** search for information in the documentation sources provided and use sequential thinking to evaluate the problem and possible solutions.
- Each phase MUST be implemented in it's own task.
- Before implementing a phase, review your documentation sources to better understand the libraries and frameworks you're leveraging as well as features and capabilities you're trying to implement for a given phase.
- Follow DRY, KISS, YAGNI, and SOLID Principles.
- Each phase MUST be implemented in it's own task.
- Only make the changes you are asked to make.
- Keep comments unless they are not relevant.
- Before implementing new features or making changes to the codebase, ALWAYS search your memories for documentation sources relevant to any external libraries or frameworks being used to ensure features and changes are implemented correctly.
- Accuracy and completeness are of utmost importance. When clarification is required, ask for it. When in doubt, seek guidance.

## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS - Applies to all tasks

- Only fix test warnings if asked to do so.
- NEVER edit the contents of any tag with an immutable property. Example: <INSTRUCTION immutable>never update this text</INSTRUCTION>
- ONLY **APPEND** to the contents of any tag with an `append` property. Example: <LOG append>never update this text - only append new text</LOG>
- ONLY **PREPEND** to the contents of any tag with an `prepend` property. Example: <LOG prepend>new text goes here - never update this text</LOG>
- ALWAYS IGNORE the contents of any tag with an `ignore` property. Example: <LOG ignore>ignore this text</LOG>
- **TASKS** tags are used to define markdown formatted lists of tasks that need to be completed. **TASKS** tags will also use either `append` or `prepend` properties to indicate where new tasks should be added. The only part of a task that may be modified is the checkbox. Example: `- [ ] Task to be completed` may become `- [x] Completed task`.

## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS - Applies BEFORE making any edits

- Search for information relevent to the edits you are about to make using your `search_documentation` tool.
- Always start a new task by reviewing `agent/standards/index.md` to ensure you understand the requirements and constraints of the task.
- When adding new constructs or features, first review `agent/design/index.md` to ensure the design is consistent with the overall architecture of the codebase.
- A high level implementation plan can be found in `agent/implementation/index.md`. Commit the phases to memory and remember how they fit together. once a phase is complete, commit it to memory.

## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS - Applies AFTER making any edits

- Commit to the git repo after making file changes using git MCPs `git_add` and `git_commit` tools. The commit descriptions should start with "feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:, test:, refactor:, style:, or perf:" followed by a brief description of the changes.
- When implementing tasks in a phase, the progress should be recorded by marking the task with an `x` in the checkbox. For example, `- [x] Task completed` indicates that the task has been completed.
- When updating the codebase, the changes should be summarized in the `checkpoints` document inside the `implementation` directory. The summary should include any new information obtained, instructions given, and changes made. The newest updates should be added to the top of the document.
- If the API has been updated, update the postman collection and environment with the new changes.
