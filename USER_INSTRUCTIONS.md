# User Instructions

Welcome to the Agentic Starter Kit.

The idea behind this repo is to give developers working with tools like Windsurf or Cline a way to manage context and keep models/agents on the right track.

## Setup

1. Start with ChatGPT (or yourself) to flesh out an overview of your project. Drop that into [design overview](./agent/design/overview.md)
